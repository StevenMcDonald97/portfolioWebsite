Login causing error with "isCorrectPassword" - user object is not a user schema object (resolved?)


Multer not storing images in upload folder
create User panel page
Need to be able to log user out
Need to be able to edit images
Need to be able to add and remove pages (keep in mongoDb)
Need to be able to edit style
	edit background colors
	edit navigation, portfolio style
	show sample portfolio styling as user edits
	add verification that all data entered is valid on submit

error on submit for style form even though it goes through fine




have clean error handling! redirect to home page with message 'something went wrong'?

PRIORITY:

Login causing error with "isCorrectPassword" - user object is not a user schema object

let users control order of links

home page style
	can have carousel of images or static image

delta images and pages- create alert "are you sure? This will remove this image(s) from everywhere on your website" before deleting) 
	-can select multiple and click "delete selected images"?
	-on save or cancel redirect to user home panel

edit portfolios:
	-can either choose existing images or upload new ones


Need to be able to edit style
	-have split screen if wide enough, or button to pop up modal (i.e. if not roughly 2:3 		ratio)  with selection tools and preview
	-enable editing background colors
	-edit navigation, portfolio style -
		nabber can be vertical or horizontal, and collapsible or fixed 
	-add verification that all data entered is valid on submit
	-on cancel redirect back to user panel page
	-let user change Font(s) (main, secondary, and third fonts?)
	-preset styles:
		-create ten based off of common themes
		-create a list in json and json for each variation, create an option or 		each
		-maybe choose from a carousel of pictures? 


use sass with node sass importer to load style variables from JSON

create contact form 
	-have to update email to load from user settings
	-nodemailer need to set smtp in route and config files properly
	-update email routes
	-test with Mailtrap.io
	
have mobile design! update view arrangement if screen size if small enough 


error on submit for style form even though it goes through fine


get rid of JSON, store everything in database except sample styles!


have clean error handling! redirect to home page with message 'something went wrong'?

remove unnecessary packages

back up data incase mongodb loses data
